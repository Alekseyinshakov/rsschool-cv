## About me
I am 32 years old, I am an operator of engineering systems at a sports facility. I became interested in the frontend a few years ago and independently mastered layout and the basics of Javascript and React. I still lack the knowledge and skills to work as a developer, so I decided to study at a RS school, on the advice of a friend. I hope I have enough patience and strength to reach the end and become a junior front-end developer.
